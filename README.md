# Two Hour Coding Challenge - React

## Challenge

Build a web app that displays images taken by NASA's Mars rovers, Opportunity and Curiosity.

## Instructions

* Use the API key `Jpz1UkzkRxdxrg9Xg69mJSleGt5HCbQzqXWUrlFR` to get rover image data from NASA's [Mars Rover Photos API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos).

* Develop a UI based on the included [wireframes](/wires) and user stories. You can use any libraries and/or frameworks you like. If a story lacks detail, use your best judgement.

* Document the build and installation processes.

* Work on a branch.

* At the end of **2 hours** push your branch to the repo and then **merge it to master via a merge request**.

## User Stories

* As a user, when the page loads, I can see the 'Image of the Day', a random image selected from those taken yesterday by either rover.

* As a user, I can navigate to a gallery displaying images taken yesterday by either rover.

* As a user, I can filter the images by camera name.

* As a user, I want to see dates formatted in the style `Month dd, yyyy`.

* As a user, I want the app to be responsive.

* **STRETCH**: As a user, I can specify the earth date for which to display images.
